When a room full of software developers meets monthly for skill sharpening and learning you have to wonder why they draw for giveaway items by hand; passing out paper to write your name on, passing them back, put in a box/hat/cup/available-container, held comically high for random's sake.

This application begun as a talk that I presented to the Utah .NET Users Group on MVC and NStack integration. Hopefully it'll mature enough that we can resume the laziness that us nerdy developers are known for, registering for the meeting and raffle items from a chair without any more human interaction than necessary.

Here's a list of initial "User Stories" that describe how I think the system should work:


##Accounts
+ Users can create an account with name, email, and password
+ Users can authenticate with email and password
+ Users can be administrators
##Admin
+ Administrators can create meetings with a description, date, and number of tickets awarded for attending
+ Administrators can add raffle items to a meeting with a Description, Image, and minimum ticket count
##Registration
+ Users can register as an attendee for a meeting
+ When a user registers they should have the ticket award for the meeting added to their cumulative ticket count
+ Users can view the current meeting and the raffle items available for that meeting and the number of tickets they have accrued
+ Users can create entries for a raffle item with as many tickets as they’d like up to the number of tickets they have acquired by attending meetings.
##Raffle
+ Administrators can run the raffle
+ The raffle process should present each item sequentially starting with the lowest required tickets moving to the highest
+ The raffle process should choose a winner by random selection from all available tickets in a stylin’ manner
+ All tickets allocated as entries by the winning user to the raffled item are forfeit
+ All tickets allocated as entries to the raffled item by non-winning users should be returned to the user
